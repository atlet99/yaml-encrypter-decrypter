## **How It Works**

### **Encryption**
1. The provided plaintext is compressed using `gzip` to reduce size.
2. A random **salt** is generated (32 bytes) to ensure unique encryption even with the same password.
3. The password is converted to a cryptographic key using one of the following key derivation functions:
   - **Argon2id** (default, OWASP recommended parameters):
     - **Memory**: 9 MB (9216 KiB)
     - **Iterations**: 4
     - **Threads**: 1
   - **PBKDF2-SHA256** (optional, NIST/FIPS compatible):
     - **Iterations**: 600,000
   - **PBKDF2-SHA512** (optional, NIST/FIPS compatible):
     - **Iterations**: 210,000
4. The plaintext is encrypted using **AES-256 GCM** (128-bit nonce, 256-bit key) for confidentiality and integrity.
5. An **HMAC** is computed to validate the integrity of the encrypted data.
6. The final result combines the salt, nonce, encrypted data, and HMAC.

### **Secure Memory Handling**
The tool implements robust memory security measures to protect sensitive data:

1. **Secure Memory Buffers**: Uses memguard to create protected memory enclaves for sensitive data.
2. **Memory Protection**: Memory containing sensitive data is protected from swapping to disk.
3. **Automatic Cleanup**: All sensitive buffers are automatically destroyed after use.
4. **Signal Handling**: Properly handles interruption signals to ensure sensitive data is wiped from memory.
5. **Buffer Lifecycle**: Explicit buffer lifecycle management with destroy calls to prevent memory leaks.
6. **Sensitive Data Protection**: Prevents sensitive data from being exposed in logs or error messages.
7. **Strong Password Requirements**: Enforces a minimum key length of 15 characters (NIST SP 800-63B compliant) for both command-line and environment variable provided keys.

### **Multiline YAML Support**
The tool provides comprehensive support for encrypting and decrypting multiline YAML content:

1. **Format Detection**: Automatically detects multiline content by analyzing YAML node style and content.
2. **Style Preservation**: Preserves original YAML multiline styles (literal `|` or folded `>`) during encryption/decryption.
3. **PEM Support**: Special handling for PEM certificates and private keys in both formats:
   - Multiline literal blocks with preserved line breaks
   - Single-line strings with escaped newlines (`\n`)
4. **Smart Formatting**: Applies appropriate style when decrypting based on content type:
   - PEM content uses literal style to preserve exact formatting
   - Content with tabs uses literal style for proper representation
   - Multiline content is formatted according to its original style when possible
5. **Seamless Operation**: No special configuration needed - multiline handling works automatically.

#### **Multiline Encryption Examples**

**After decryption (back to original content with preserved styles):**
```yaml

```

#### **How Multiline Processing Works**

When processing multiline YAML content, the tool:

1. **During encryption**:
   - Detects if content is multiline or contains escaped newlines (`\n`)
   - Identifies PEM certificates and keys with special pattern detection
   - Preserves style information during encryption
   - Adds special markers for escaped newline format when needed

2. **During decryption**:
   - Examines the encrypted data and any style markers
   - Restores the appropriate style based on content type and original format
   - Uses appropriate YAML style (literal `|` or double-quoted `"..."`) based on content
   - Special handling for PEM certificates to maintain correct formatting

This ensures that all forms of multiline content, including certificates and keys, maintain their exact formatting and representation after encryption and decryption cycles.

### **Key Derivation Algorithms**
Choose from multiple key derivation algorithms with the `--algorithm` flag:
```bash
./bin/yed --file config.yaml --key="my-secure-key" --operation encrypt --algorithm argon2id
```

Available algorithms:
- `argon2id` (default): Memory-hard algorithm with OWASP recommended parameters
- `pbkdf2-sha256`: NIST/FIPS compatible with 600,000 iterations
- `pbkdf2-sha512`: NIST/FIPS compatible with 210,000 iterations (provides best balance of security and performance)

### **Debug Mode Improvements**
The enhanced debug mode provides detailed insights into the encryption/decryption process:

```bash
./bin/yed --file config.yaml --key="my-secure-key" --operation encrypt --debug
```

Debug output now includes:
- Algorithm detection for each encrypted value
- Field path information for better context
- Length of encrypted data
- Enhanced masking of sensitive values

Example debug output:
```
[DEBUG] Masking encrypted value for field 'smart_config.auth.username' (length: 184, algo: argon2id)
```

This helps in troubleshooting and understanding the encryption process without compromising security.

### **Decryption**
1. The encrypted data is decoded and split into its components: salt, nonce, ciphertext, and HMAC.
2. The password is used to regenerate the cryptographic key using the extracted salt.
3. The HMAC is recomputed and validated.
4. The ciphertext is decrypted using **AES-256 GCM**.
5. The decompressed data is returned as plaintext.

## **Getting Started**

### **Requirements**
- Go 1.24.1+ installed.
- Make installed on your system.

### **Steps**
1. Clone the repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/atlet99/yaml-encrypter-decrypter.git;
cd yaml-encryptor-decryptor
```

2. Install dependencies:
```bash
make install-deps
```

3. Build the application:
```bash
make build
```

4. Run the tool:
```bash
./bin/yed --help
```

## **Usage**

### **Configuration**

The tool uses a `.yed_config.yml` file for customizable behavior. By default, this file should be placed in the working directory. You can specify a custom path to the configuration file using the `--config` flag.

**Example usage with custom config path:**
```bash
./bin/yed --file config.yaml --key="my-super-secure-key" --operation encrypt --config /path/to/custom/.yed_config.yml
```

**Example `.yed_config.yml`:**
```yaml
encryption:
  rules:
    - name: "skip_axel_fix"
      block: "axel.fix"
      pattern: "**"
      action: "none"
      description: "Skip encryption for all values in axel.fix block"
    
    - name: "encrypt_smart_config"
      block: "smart_config"
      pattern: "**"
      description: "Encrypt all values in smart_config block"
    
    - name: "encrypt_passwords"
      block: "*"
      pattern: "pass*"
      description: "Encrypt all password fields globally"
  
  unsecure_diff: false  # Set to true to show actual values in diff mode
```

### **Rule Configuration**

Rules in `.yed_config.yml` define which parts of your YAML file should be encrypted or skipped. Each rule consists of:

- `name`: A unique identifier for the rule
- `block`: The YAML block to which the rule applies (e.g., "smart_config" or "*" for any block)
- `pattern`: Pattern for matching fields within the block (e.g., "**" for all fields, "pass*" for fields starting with "pass")
- `action`: Optional. Use "none" to skip encryption for matching paths
- `description`: Human-readable description of the rule's purpose

**Important Rule Processing Details:**

1. **Priority Order**: Rules with `action: none` are processed first to ensure paths are properly excluded from encryption.
2. **Recursive Exclusion**: When a path matches a rule with `action: none`, all its nested paths are also excluded from encryption.
3. **Pattern Matching**:
   - `**` matches any number of nested fields
   - `*` matches any characters within a single field name
   - Exact matches take precedence over patterns

**Example Rule Applications:**

```yaml
# Example YAML structure
smart_config:
  auth:
    username: "admin"
    password: "secret123"
axel:
  fix:
    name: "test"
    password: "test123"
```

With the example rules above:
- All fields under `smart_config` will be encrypted
- All fields under `axel.fix` will be skipped (not encrypted)
- Any field matching `pass*` in other blocks will be encrypted

### **Environment Variable**

Override the encryption key with `YED_ENCRYPTION_KEY`:
```bash
export YED_ENCRYPTION_KEY="my-super-p@s$w0rd123"
```
**Password Requirements:**
- **Minimum**: 16 characters
- **Maximum**: 64 characters (supports passphrases)
- **Recommendation**: Use a mix of uppercase, lowercase, numbers, and special characters
- **Avoid**: Common passwords will be rejected for security

### **Command-Line Interface**

*The tool provides various options to encrypt and decrypt data:*

**Available Options:**
```

### **Testing Capabilities**

The project provides comprehensive testing capabilities:

#### **Automated Tests**
Run the full test suite with race detection and coverage:
```bash
make test
```

#### **Manual Tests**
Test specific files from `.test` directory:
```bash
make test-manual
```

This will test `cert-test.yml` from the `.test` directory using the following steps:
1. Create a copy of the original test file (`cert-test-copy.yml`) to preserve the original
2. First test with dry-run mode to check without making changes
3. Then test with debug mode for detailed operation information
4. Finally test the decryption process
5. All changes are made to the copy file, leaving the original intact

The original test files remain unchanged during testing, which makes it safe to run repeated tests.

#### **Performance Benchmarks**
Run different benchmark sets to evaluate performance:

```bash
# Run basic benchmarks
make benchmark

# Run more detailed benchmarks with longer duration
make benchmark-long

# Run specific benchmarks for encryption/decryption
make benchmark-encryption

# Generate a comprehensive benchmark report
make benchmark-report
```

### **Docker Support**

The tool can be built and run inside a Docker container:

```bash
# Build the Docker image
make build-image

# Run the tool inside a Docker container
make run-image
```

### **Advanced Features**

#### **Multiple Key Derivation Algorithms**

Choose between different key derivation algorithms when encrypting/decrypting:

```bash
# Use Argon2id (default)
./bin/yed --file config.yaml --key="my-secure-key" --operation encrypt --algorithm argon2id

# Use PBKDF2-SHA256 (NIST/FIPS compatible, faster)
./bin/yed --file config.yaml --key="my-secure-key" --operation encrypt --algorithm pbkdf2-sha256

# Use PBKDF2-SHA512 (NIST/FIPS compatible, balanced security/performance)
./bin/yed --file config.yaml --key="my-secure-key" --operation encrypt --algorithm pbkdf2-sha512
```

#### **Specialized Test Files**

The project includes a `.test` directory with various test files:
- `cert-test.yml` - For testing certificate encryption/decryption
- `config-test.yml` - For testing configuration encryption
- `variables.yml` - For testing variable substitution
- `.yed_config.yml` - Special configuration for testing

These files can be used for manual testing and verification of encryption/decryption functionality:

```bash
# Manually test a specific file from .test directory
./bin/yed --file .test/cert-test.yml --key="my-secure-key" --operation encrypt --config=.test/.yed_config.yml
```

### **Code Quality Tools**

The project integrates multiple code quality tools:

```bash
# Run all code quality checks
make check-all

# Run static code analysis
make staticcheck

# Run linter
make lint

# Fix linting issues automatically 
make lint-fix
```

### **Security Best Practices**

The project implements several security best practices:

1. **Secure Memory Handling**: All sensitive data is handled in protected memory areas
2. **Strong Password Requirements**: Proper validation of encryption keys
3. **Multiple Encryption Algorithms**: Support for both Argon2id and PBKDF2 for different compliance requirements
4. **Masking of Sensitive Data**: Proper handling of sensitive information in logs and outputs
5. **Explicit Buffer Cleanup**: Explicit destruction of sensitive buffers to prevent memory leaks

### **Continuous Integration**

The project uses GitHub Actions for continuous integration with workflows for:
- Building and testing on multiple platforms
- Security scanning with Trivy, Nancy, and OSSF Scorecard
- Code quality checks with golangci-lint and staticcheck
- Automatic version bumping for releases

### **Build Cross-Platform Binaries**

*You can build binaries for multiple platforms using:*
```bash

---

### **Algorithms Used**

1. **AES-256 GCM:**
   * Authenticated encryption for data confidentiality and integrity.
   * Ensures encrypted data cannot be tampered with.
2. **Argon2id:**
   * Secure password-based key derivation, winner of the 2015 Password Hashing Competition.
   * Configured according to OWASP recommendations for optimal security-performance balance.
   * Memory-hard to resist brute-force attacks, especially GPU-based ones.
3. **HMAC-SHA256:**
   * Validates integrity of encrypted data.
4. **Gzip Compression:**
   * Reduces size of plaintext before encryption.

### **Performance Measurement**

**The tool automatically measures the time taken for encryption, decryption, and YAML file processing.**

*Example:*
```bash
./bin/yed --file test.yml --key="my-super-secure-key" --operation encrypt
```

*Output:*
```bash
YAML processing completed in 227.072083ms
File test.yml updated successfully.
```

*Dry-run mode with diff:*
```bash
./bin/yed --file test.yml --key="my-super-secure-key" --operation encrypt --dry-run --diff
YAML processing completed in 237.009042ms
Dry-run mode: The following changes would be applied:
```

### **License**

This is an open source project under the [MIT](https://github.com/atlet99/yaml-encrypter-decrypter/blob/main/LICENSE) license.

### **Environment Variables**

You can override command-line flags using environment variables:

```bash
# Set encryption key (must be at least 16 characters long)
export YED_ENCRYPTION_KEY="my-super-secure-key"

# Then run without specifying key on command line
./bin/yed --file config.yaml --operation encrypt
```

The environment variable approach provides an alternative to passing sensitive data on the command line, which might be visible in process listings.

## YAML Format Preservation

This tool preserves YAML formatting during encryption and decryption operations:

- Literal style (`|`) is fully supported and preserved
- Folded style (`>` or `>-`) is preserved using a special handling mechanism
- Double-quoted and single-quoted values maintain their original style
- Plain scalars remain plain after decryption

### Folded Style Support

YAML folded style (`>` or `>-`) is specially handled to maintain its formatting. The tool:

1. Identifies folded style sections in the YAML document
2. Temporarily replaces them with placeholders during processing
3. Restores the original formatting after encryption/decryption

This approach ensures that folded style sections are not corrupted during encryption/decryption operations.
